This is one provided data file containing various passages of text. The
program will be tested usually without most of the tricky punctuation,
but there may be some, such as commas, periods, quote marks, and
question marks.

I will give a small amount of extra credit (5 points) if your program
removes punctuation marks in searching for values. For example, if the
word was "values", then the end of the previous sentence can be treated
in two possible ways:

The extra credit occurs if you remove the period or (any other forms of
punctuation marks that may apply).

Name your program prog02.cpp or prog02.c. Any programs named otherwise
will not be examined. You should leave the program in your directory on
your "regular" VM. If it will be late, then please notify me. Otherwise, I
will check your directories on regal after the due date. It may be helpful
to create a Prog02 subdirectory into which you place your program source.

In your comment block to begin your main program, other than the function
of the program and the variable dictionary, include a comment of the
following format.
