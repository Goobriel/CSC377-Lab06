If then else is a C++ construct.
The actions of the file reader threads should be defined in one function,
such that parameters passed to it allow it to identify itself, the
file it reads, and what it should do. Its actions are fairly simple:
read through an entire file of text looking for a particular word
and counting occurrences of that word. The word should be treated as
case-insensitive. (For example, "The" = "the" = "thE" etc.)

This one should be even more straightforward, as its primary purpose in
life is for you to demonstrate correct usage of a condition wait. This
thread simply executes a wait on the condition variable so that it sleeps
until one of the other two threads set the final count (or the boolean
variable indicating the final count has been set). When this thread is
awakened by the condition signal, it prints out the name of the file
containing the higher count, and what that count was.

Note that the information necessary for this thread to print these
values can easily be stored in some global variables that are protected
by the mutext locking and unlocking, etc. I suggest that this includes
the previously mentioned global count variable, as well as some kind of
global file name variable.
